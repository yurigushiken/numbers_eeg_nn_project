# EEGNeX on raw EEG (30 Hz) â€“ Base config for the Consolidated Optuna Study.
# This file FIXES the "solved" parameters and uses fast-search settings.
# It is designed to be used with optuna_space_eegnex_consolidated.yaml.

model_name: eegnex

# --- Data Loading ---
dataset_dir: "data_preprocessed/all_trials_dataset (30hz)"
n_folds: 4 # WHY: Use 4-fold CV for a fast and efficient search.

# --- Training (for fast search) ---
epochs: 40
early_stop: 10

# --- FIXED Architectural Parameters (from Trial 24) ---
# These were the clear winners from the first study and are now fixed.

# --- FIXED Augmentation "Strength" Parameters (from Trial 217) ---
# These are not being tuned in the consolidated search, so we use the best
# values we found in the dedicated augmentation study.
