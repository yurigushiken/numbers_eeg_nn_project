# EEGNeX on raw EEG (45 Hz) â€“ Base config for the STAGE 1 Architecture Search.
# This file FIXES the "solved" parameters and uses the best-known augmentations.
# It is designed to be used with optuna_space_eegnex_45hz_arch.yaml.

model_name: eegnex

# --- Data Loading ---
dataset_dir: "data_preprocessed/all_trials_dataset (45hz) V2"
n_folds: 4 # Use 4-fold CV for a fast and efficient search

# --- Training (for fast search) ---
epochs: 40
early_stop: 10

# --- FIXED Architectural Parameters (from previous studies) ---
# These were the clear winners and are now fixed to reduce search space.
depth_multiplier: 1

# --- FIXED Augmentation "Strength" Parameters (from Champion Trial 217) ---
# These are not being tuned in this architecture search, so we use the best
# values we found in the dedicated 30Hz augmentation study.
